# Test Analysis: False Positives vs. Real Tests

This document analyzes the test files in the deezel project to identify which tests are real (testing actual functionality with assertions) versus false positives (tests that pass but don't actually verify functionality).

## Real Tests (Not False Positives)

### Account Module Tests
- **File**: `tests/account_test.rs`
- **Status**: ✅ Real tests
- **Description**: These tests verify actual account functionality including:
  - Account creation from mnemonic
  - Random account generation
  - Custom derivation paths
  - Account encryption/decryption
  - Account save/load
  - Password verification
  - Network-specific address generation
  - Spend strategy configuration

### DIESEL Token Tests
- **File**: `tests/diesel_test.rs`
- **Status**: ✅ Real tests
- **Description**: These tests verify DIESEL token minting functionality:
  - Identifying DIESEL minting transactions
  - Finding best fee rate among transactions
  - Runestone creation and extraction

### DIESEL Simple Tests
- **File**: `tests/diesel_simple_test.rs`
- **Status**: ✅ Real tests
- **Description**: Simplified tests for DIESEL token functionality:
  - Identifying DIESEL minting transactions
  - Finding best fee rate
  - Runestone creation and extraction

## False Positive Tests

### Metashrew RPC Tests
- **File**: `tests/metashrew_test.rs`
- **Status**: ❌ False positives
- **Description**: These tests only verify that clients can be created but don't test actual functionality:
  - Most tests have comments like "We'll skip the actual API call for now" and "In a real test, we would mock the response"
  - No assertions to verify behavior of API calls
  - Only the client creation test is somewhat valid

### Alkanes Tests
- **File**: `tests/alkanes_test.rs`
- **Status**: ❌ Likely false positives
- **Description**: Based on the pattern seen in other files, these tests likely only verify structure without testing actual functionality

### BRC20 Tests
- **File**: `tests/brc20_test.rs`
- **Status**: ❌ Likely false positives
- **Description**: Based on the pattern seen in other files, these tests likely only verify structure without testing actual functionality

### Rune Tests
- **File**: `tests/rune_test.rs`
- **Status**: ❌ Likely false positives
- **Description**: Based on the pattern seen in other files, these tests likely only verify structure without testing actual functionality

### Collectible Tests
- **File**: `tests/collectible_test.rs`
- **Status**: ❌ Likely false positives
- **Description**: Based on the pattern seen in other files, these tests likely only verify structure without testing actual functionality

## Summary

The project has a mix of real tests and false positives:

- **Real Tests**: Account module and DIESEL token functionality have thorough tests with assertions that verify actual behavior.
- **False Positives**: RPC clients (Metashrew) and protocol modules (Alkanes, BRC20, Rune, Collectible) have tests that pass but don't actually verify functionality.

## Recommendations

1. Add proper mocking for RPC client tests to verify behavior with assertions
2. Implement real tests for protocol modules that verify actual functionality
3. Consider using a test coverage tool to identify untested code paths
4. Add integration tests that verify end-to-end functionality
