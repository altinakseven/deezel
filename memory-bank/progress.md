## Notes

- The current implementation focuses on structure and interfaces, with many placeholder implementations that need to be filled in.
- The RPC client implementation is a critical next step, as it's required for most functionality.
- Transaction construction and signing are also high priority, as they're used by all protocol implementations.
- The CLI implementation can be done incrementally as the underlying functionality is implemented.
