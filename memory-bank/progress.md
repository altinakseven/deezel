# Project Progress

## Current Status

The project is in the **initial development phase**. We have established the project structure, gathered reference implementations, created comprehensive documentation, and implemented the basic module structure. The core functionality implementation is in progress. Our goal is to create a comprehensive toolkit for interacting with Bitcoin and the alkanes metaprotocol using BDK with a custom JSON-RPC provider, replacing the need for esplora while adding metashrew_view RPC calls for rendering alkanes view functions.
