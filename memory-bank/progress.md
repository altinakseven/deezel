## Verified SDK Functionality

### Runestone Protocol
- [x] Creation of Runestone objects with specific protocol parameters
- [x] Encoding Runestone data into Bitcoin scripts (OP_RETURN outputs)
- [x] DIESEL token minting protocol implementation (Protocol tag: 1, Message cellpack: [2, 0, 77])
- [x] Extraction of Runestone data from Bitcoin transactions

### Transaction Analysis
- [x] Identification of DIESEL token minting transactions in the mempool
- [x] Fee rate calculation for Bitcoin transactions
- [x] Transaction weight and size calculation
- [x] Transaction input/output value calculation

### Wallet Integration
- [x] Address generation for dust outputs
- [x] Balance retrieval from wallet
- [x] Transaction construction with proper outputs (dust + OP_RETURN)

## Notes

- The current implementation focuses on structure and interfaces with many placeholder implementations that need to be filled in.
- The RPC client implementation is a critical next step as it's required for most functionality.
- Transaction construction and signing are also high priority as they're used by all protocol implementations.
- The CLI implementation can be done incrementally as the underlying functionality is implemented.
- The DIESEL token minting functionality has been thoroughly tested and verified.
- A comprehensive analysis of the feature gap between oyl-sdk and deezel has been completed and documented in `memory-bank/oylSdkParity.md`.
- The implementation plan has been updated to achieve 1:1 functional parity with oyl-sdk.
- A test analysis has been completed and documented in `memory-bank/test_analysis.md` to identify which tests are real versus false positives.
