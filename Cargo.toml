# Deezel Monorepo Workspace
# 
# This workspace contains:
# - deezel: CLI binary crate with system calls and argument parsing
# - deezel-common: Core library with all business logic for WASM compatibility
#
# The deezel-common crate contains all the actual logic and can be compiled to WASM,
# while the deezel crate provides the CLI interface and system-specific implementations.
